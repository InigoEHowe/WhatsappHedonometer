# This uses data from https://hedonometer.org/about.html to extract statisatics from a 2 person Whatsapp chat
# Plots are generated taking an average from a number of days indicated in the input parameters below
# Please refer to the README file for infomation on how the program functions.

# INPUT PARAMETERS
word_happiness = pd.read_csv (r'Hedonometer.csv') # Here replace Hedonometer.csv with the filename of the data from https://hedonometer.org/about.html
whatsapp_data = 'whatsApp.txt' # filepath to the whatsapp chat data

    #'1. Dodds, P., Harris, K., Kloumann, I., Bliss, C. and Danforth, C., 2020.Â 
    #Temporal Patterns Of Happiness And Information In A Global Social Network: Hedonometrics And Twitter.'

## Construct a pandas Dataframe holding the Whatsapp data
# The following stucture is used: Date (Datetime), Time (Datetime), Author (string), Message (string), TotalTime (numpy.int64)

## PREPROCESSING
# The following program extracts two pieces of infomation, Data_x shows for each period all the messages sent by user x in 
# one string as well as the number sent the period, the average length of messages sent in the period, the average happiness of
# words in the period that exist in the word_happiness variable and the Date in the middle of the given period.

## PLOTTING
# This will generate plots against the Date sent
# The following checks that any words being examined are 
for word in words:
    if not (word_happiness['Word'].eq(word)).any():
        print(' Warning: \''+word+'\' is not in the happiness list, consider adding it yourself')
